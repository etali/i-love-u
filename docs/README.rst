i-love-you (I got this from https://github.com/caian-org/i-love-u)
==========

``i-love-u`` is a tiny program that generates a lovely digital valentine's
day card. It is aesthetically inspired by `ythecombinator`_'s
`happy-valentines`_, but with a twist -- it can draw an ASCII heart with the
name of your beloved one.

Requirements
------------

Love and tender. And Python. Any version should do it.


Usage
-----

Simply replace the last bit with the name you want and send the whole thing.


Motivation
----------

I wrote this as some sort of gift to a person I love and care very much. It's
kinda silly, but... isn't all the love letters a bit silly too? Don't think too
much, just enjoy the date.
